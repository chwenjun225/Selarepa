# Method and device for foundation multi-agent system

## ABSTRACT
The present invention is a device and method for human brain-inspired cognitive processing. A hardware cognitive processing unit emulates key brain subsystems including a neuromorphic memory module, a predictive inference engine, an emotion-inspired valuation module, and a goal-management subsystem interconnected via an attention-gated data bus. The unit supports hardware-efficient associative learning and parameter-efficient adaptation to enable context-aware reasoning and long-horizon planning.
