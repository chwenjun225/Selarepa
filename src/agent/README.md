### 1.3 A modular and brain-inspired AI agent framework 

One core issue in the LLM era is the *lack of unified framework* that integrates the rich cognitive and functional components required by advanced agents. While LLMs offer exceptional language reasoning capabilities, many current agent designs remin *ad hoc* - they incorporeate modules like perception, memory, or planning in a piecemeal fashion, failling to approximate the well-coordinated specialization seen in biological systems such as the human brain. Unlike current LLM agents, the human brain seamlessly balances perception, memory, reasoning, and action through distinct yet interconnected regions, facilitating adaptive responses to complex stimuli. LLM-driven agents, by constast, oftent stumble when tasks require cross-domain or multimodal integration, highlightin the need for a more holistic appraoch akin the the brain's functional diversity. Motivated by these parallels, our survey advocates drawing inspiration from the human brain to systematically analuze and dsign agetn frameworks. This perpspective shows that bigological system achieve general intelligence by blending specialized components (for perception, reasonng, action, etc.) in a tughtly integrated fashion -- an approach that could serve as a blueprint for strengthinging current LLM-based agent

Neuroscienctific resarch reveals that the brain leverages both reational circuits (e.g., the neocortext, enabling deliberation and planning) and emotional circuits (e.g., the limbic system) to guide decision-making. Memory formation involves the hipp campus and cortical mechanism., wheile reward signals, mediated by dopaminergic and other neuromodulatetory pathways, reinfoce behavior and learning. These biological insight inspire several dsing principles for AI agents , including but it limited to...
